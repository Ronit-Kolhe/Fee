## Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x

2.  **Clone the repository or download the source code:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Directory Structure:**
    The application expects the following directory structure. It will create these folders automatically when you first run the application.
    ```
    /
    |-- main.py
    |-- requirements.txt
    |-- db/
    |   |-- students.db
    |-- receipts/
    |-- templates/
        |-- logo.png
    ```
    * Place your school's logo in the `templates` folder and name it `logo.png`.
    * If you have the `Arial.ttf` font file, place it in the `templates` folder to ensure the Rupee symbol (â‚¹) renders correctly on the PDF receipts.
